# ML_Project_Sonar_Rock_VS_Mine_Prediction_with_Python
This project is a machine learning endeavor aimed at solving a critical real-world problem: distinguishing between underwater objects as either rocks or mines using sonar data. This project leverages Python's extensive ecosystem of machine learning libraries and tools to develop a predictive model capable of making accurate classifications.
